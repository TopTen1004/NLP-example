I have a dataset of NLP around 50k records
and the labels are multi-label classification.

The code is requested to be in Python and all in one script with proper comments on each line

The targeted accuracy is F1-Score of 0.7

It is very important to get this accuracy or above (without it the requirements won't be met)


Attached is a sample of the dataset

Some info about the dataset
* Around 60K records
* Around 30K features
* Around 1400 Labels (Multi-Label Classification)

You will need NLP preprocessing techniques and Algorithms (BOW, TFIDF, RNN, LSTM, etc)
